class ConnectFourState:
    """
    Represents the Connect 4 board as two binary numbers; the piece mask
    and the player mask. Each bit in the numbers correspond to a field on
    the board as such:

    .  .  .  .  .  .  .
    5 12 19 26 33 40 47
    4 11 18 25 32 39 46
    3 10 17 24 31 38 45
    2  9 16 23 30 37 44
    1  8 15 22 29 36 43
    0  7 14 21 28 35 42

    Bitboard representation for a 7x6 board. The bits marked by dots
    are left blank to prevent a four in a row from the top of one row
    to the bottom of the next.

    The piece mask describes which fields contain a piece, and the
    player mask describes which of those pieces belong to the current
    player.

    Though the move count could be inferred from the piece mask,
    this state also keeps a separate move count.
